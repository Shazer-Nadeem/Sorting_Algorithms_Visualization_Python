# Sorting Algorithms Visualization in Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Python project that visualizes various sorting algorithms using step-by-step animations. It provides a clear understanding of how sorting algorithms like Heap Sort and others work by breaking down their processes into easily digestible steps. This is a great resource for educational purposes or anyone interested in learning how different sorting techniques function under the hood.

## Language and Libraries
The project is implemented in Python, which offers readability, simplicity, and rapid development for educational purposes. It focuses on implementing sorting algorithms and visualizing them in an intuitive manner.

### Key Libraries Utilized
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations of the sorting algorithms.
- **NumPy**: Provides fast array manipulation and numeric computations, making sorting more efficient.
- **NetworkX**: Represents the heap data structure as a graph for easier visualization.
- **FuncAnimation (Matplotlib)**: Facilitates step-by-step animations for demonstrating each algorithmâ€™s sorting process.
